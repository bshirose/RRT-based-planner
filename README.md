# RRT based for high DOF robots

Welcome to the repository housing a basic yet effective implementation of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) for graph generation and planning. Here, you'll find header files and planners for RRT, RRT-Connect, and RRT* algorithms, along with a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) based graph generation module.
Key Features:

    RRT Planning Algorithms: Implementations of RRT, RRT-Connect, and RRT* algorithms, providing efficient and versatile solutions for robot path planning in complex environments.

    Header Files: Accessible header files containing essential data structures and functions for RRT-based planning, enabling seamless integration and customization within your workflow.

    PRM Graph Generation: A PRM-based graph generation module that offers an alternative approach to building roadmaps for robot navigation, enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

How to Use:

    Clone this repository to your local environment or incorporate it as a submodule within your project structure.
    Explore the provided header files and planners to understand their functionalities and interfaces.
    Choose the appropriate planning algorithm (RRT, RRT-Connect, or RRT*) based on your specific requirements and objectives.
    Utilize the PRM-based graph generation module to generate roadmaps tailored to your environment and navigation needs.
    Refer to the accompanying documentation and code comments for detailed usage instructions and insights into algorithmic implementations.
